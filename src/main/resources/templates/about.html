            <h1>WHO IS STEM?</h1>
            <p>We are <b>Susanna, Tanvir, Emir and Mattias.</b>
             STEM originally means family or tribe.<br> But it also is used in education where it stands for Science, Technology, Engineering <br>and Math(STEM).
            For this project we have used GitHub where we did the sprintboard.<br>Through whole project we have had some struggles with the GitHub, like not having<br> right version or merge problems and everything else that came along through project.<br>
            Another struggle we had that took time is how to write Tests. It took us a good while <br>to get it done. <br> It have been other bumps on the road, but we have been good at being there for each other.<br>
                <b>Peace out!</b>
                <br>
